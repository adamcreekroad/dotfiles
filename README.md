# Adam's Dotfiles

Collection of common configuration for my local development environment, so that I don't have to manually copy over / set everything up from scratch.

## Installation

All files are maintained in the repo, and symlinked where necessary into the home directory.

Setup is as simple as running this script:
```zsh
./setup.sh
```
