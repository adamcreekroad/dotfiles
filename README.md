# Adam's Dotfiles

Collection of common configuration for my local development environment, so that I don't have to manually copy over / set everything up from scratch.

## Installation

All files are maintained in the repo, and symlinked where necessary into the home directory.

To fun the full setup on a new machine:
```shell-script
./initial-setup.sh
```

To only run the symlinker:
```shell-script
./symlink.sh
```
